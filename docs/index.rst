OntoEnv Documentation
=====================

`OntoEnv` is a lightweight environment manager for RDF ontologies. The project ships a Rust core, a Python package, and a CLI so you can fetch, inspect, and reuse ontology imports from scripts or the command line. The autogenerated Rust API reference lives on docs.rs and is linked below for convenience.
